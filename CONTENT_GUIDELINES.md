## 📸 Article Images - Best Practices

### Why Article Images Matter
Having cover images for articles significantly improves user engagement and the overall reading experience:

**✅ Benefits of Having Article Images:**
- **Better Visual Appeal**: Images make your article list more attractive and professional
- **Higher Click Rates**: Articles with images get 94% more views than those without
- **Better Recognition**: Users can quickly identify and remember articles
- **Professional Look**: Images give your content a polished, magazine-like appearance
- **Social Sharing**: When shared, articles with images look much better on social media

**❌ Drawbacks of Missing Images:**
- Articles appear less professional
- Lower engagement rates
- Generic placeholder looks uninviting
- Reduced shareability on social platforms
- Harder for users to differentiate between articles

### Recommendation: **ALWAYS ADD IMAGES** ✨
We **strongly recommend** adding cover images to all articles. Even a simple, relevant image is better than no image at all.

### Where to Find Free, High-Quality Images:
1. **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com) - Professional photos, completely free
2. **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com) - High-quality stock photos
3. **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com) - Free images and illustrations
4. **Canva** (https://www.canva.com) - Create custom graphics

### Image Specifications:
- **Recommended Size**: 1200 x 630 pixels (ideal for social sharing)
- **Minimum Size**: 800 x 400 pixels
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File Size**: Keep under 500 KB for fast loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 2:1 works best
